# The following function aims at applying adaptive thresholding.
# Thresholding is the process of setting pixels with 
# intensity greater than some value to be white and less 
# than the value to be black. A more advanced technique is 
# adaptive thresholding, where the threshold value for a 
# pixel is determined by the pixel intensities of its neighbors.
# This can be helpful when lighting conditions change 
# over different regions in an image. 
# A major benefit of thresholding is denoising an 
# imageâ€”keeping only the most important elements.
